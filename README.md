# spring-boot-test
Experimenting with Spring Boot

## Goals
* Use the Spring Boot framework for an API project
* Use a Swagger contract to generate an API
* Develop the API intelligence in Java
* Use Swagger UI to display and document the API
* Document the learning time of the above

## Learning curve
* Created maven project with IntelliJ and added spring dependency - 1h
* Using [the spring doc](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current-SNAPSHOT/reference/htmlsingle/#getting-started-first-application-code) to create a hello world example, run it with IntelliJ (debug is available), and creating an executable Jar - 25mins
* First created a skeleton of the API contract from the [online swagger editor](http://editor.swagger.io/#/) and download the json file.  
Then used swagger-codegen to generate the java classes in my Spring project.  
total : 1h
