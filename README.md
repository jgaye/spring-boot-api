# spring-boot-test
Experimenting with Spring Boot

## Goals
* Use the Spring Boot framework for an API project
* Use a Swagger contract to generate an API
* Develop the API intelligence in Java
* Use Swagger UI to display and document the API
* Document the learning time of the above

## Learning curve
* Created maven project with IntelliJ and added spring dependency - 1h
* Using [the spring doc](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current-SNAPSHOT/reference/htmlsingle/#getting-started-first-application-code) to create a hello world example, run it with IntelliJ (debug is available), and creating an executable Jar - 25mins
* First created a skeleton of the API contract from the [online swagger editor](http://editor.swagger.io/#/) and download the json file.  
Then used swagger-codegen to generate the java classes in my Spring project.  
total : 1h
* Switched to a fully generated project, running from the generated jar file. - 1h

## Getting started

Generate the API Java classes from the JSON API contract with the command line  
> swagger-codegen generate -i api-contract.json -l spring

Generate the executable jar with  
> mvn clean install

Start it with the command line  
> java -jar target/swagger-spring-1.0.0.jar
Or by running the Jar directly in IntelliJ to have access to debug mode  

The Swagger UI is at http://localhost:8080/myapi/swagger-ui.html  


## Codegen Overview  
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  
By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core), you can easily generate a server stub.  
This is an example of building a swagger-enabled server in Java using the SpringBoot framework.  

The underlying library integrating swagger to SpringBoot is [springfox](https://github.com/springfox/springfox)  

Start your server as an simple java application  

You can view the api documentation in swagger-ui by pointing to  
http://localhost:8080/  

Change default port value in application.properties
